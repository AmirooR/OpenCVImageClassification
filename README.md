Image Classification with OpenCV
================================

Some experiments for image classification with opencv

- currently uses HOG features ( borrowed from Stephan Gould's darwin)
- Runs opencv K-means (dictionary learning)
- Uses opencv kdtree to find approximate nearest neighbours for coding
- Uses max pooling as the final code of each image
- some other utilities, etc
